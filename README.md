- Current focus is on Chrome behaviour


## How to release a new version
```
yarn publish --registry http://localhost:4873 --new-version 0.0.8
```

# Opportunities
- expose passed constraints to PermissionPrompt
- Error handling for different browsers (spec compliance is still not 100%)
- support for composite devices
